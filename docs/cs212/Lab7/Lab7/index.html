          <p>
            In this lab you will implement a mad lib via a web form and a custom
            server response.  If you have never played a mad lib before,
            <a href="https://www.madtakes.com/">you can play one here</a>.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            <strong>This lab requires that you first
              <a href="switch_to_express.html">switch to using ExpressJS</a>
              as your web server software!</strong>
          </p>
        </section>
      
      
        <section>
          <h1>Instructions</h1>
      
          <p>
            First, if you haven't already,
            <a href="switch_to_express.html">switch to using ExpressJS</a>.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Next, plan your mad lib.  Ensure that it has, at minimum, five slots.
            Note the types of words that should fill each slot such as plural noun,
            adjective, etc..
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Next create a new webpage accessible at the URL<br>
            <a>http://&lt;your_web_site&gt;/cs212/lab7</a>
          </p>
      
          <p>
            This page should contain a <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> element with the
            attributes necessary to cause a POST which is submitted to <strong>the
            same URL that the form is served from</strong>; how to do this in the
            class recording on forms.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            This form should have a minimum of five textual input fields.  The label
            of each input element should describe the type of input necessary to fill
            in a gap in your mad lib.  Of course, your form should cointain a submit
            button as well.
          </p>
      
          <p>
            Finally, you should wire up a <code>server.post()</code> route handler in
            your "server.js" file which should send back a textual response which is
            the mad lib filled in with the information provided by the user.  There
            is nothing complex to be done in this route handler, just use string
            interpolation and/or concatenation to insert the information from the
            form into your mad lib string and pass it off to <code>res.send()</code>.
