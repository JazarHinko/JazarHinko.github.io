Introduction
</h2>
<p>
As of 2021, over half of the world’s population has entangled themselves in the constantly 
changing world of social media. Evolving in every way possible, these applications have 
taken hold on over four billion peoples’ minds. By spending countless hours watching short, 
three minute videos that, “...show the maximum content in minimal time,” younger generations 
have been exposed to shortened attention spans (Gillick 3). It’s not just social media though, 
all different types of technology have changed the way people think during school and everyday 
life. In his publication, Gillick also states that, “Students who spent more time on media had 
higher levels of emotional distress, lacked energy and focus…” (Gillick 4). With the rise of 
social media and technology in general, concern for its impacts on the attention span of children 
being raised are becoming more and more common. This paper will aim to explore the various ways 
in which media and technology can negatively affect the attention span of younger generations.
</p>


<h2>
Assessing Attention Span
</h2>
<p>
There are several ways to assess attention span, including standardized examinations and 
computer-based evaluations. One common method is to use cognitive exercises that require 
sustained attention, such as the Continuous Performance Test (CPT), which assesses the 
ability to respond to particular stimuli over time.  According to a study published in the 
<i>Journal of Speech, Language and Hearing Research</i>, the CPT is a reliable and valid measure 
of attention span in both children and adults. They found that “adults showed no difference 
in error propensity across the 3 conditions but had slower reaction times for auditory stimuli. 
Children had slower overall reaction times." (Roebuck et al.) The CPT can be a useful tool for 
clinicians and researchers to assess attentional abilities in individuals of different ages. 
However, it is important to note that attention span is just one aspect of attentional 
functioning, and other measures may be needed to fully evaluate an individual's attentional 
abilities. 
</p>
<p>
Now that I have talked about what attention span is and how it's measured, I want to talk 
about how social media has changed the way people consume information. Excessive use of social 
media promotes a constant need for stimulation and instant gratification, leading to 
difficulties in maintaining focus on tasks that require sustained attention. And with this 
constant need for instant gratification it can lead to overuse of technology. An article titled 
<i>Impact of Social Media on Our Attention Span and its Drastic Aftermath</i> states that 
“Over-usage of technology harms the brain systems connecting emotional processing, attention and 
decision-making.”(Ashrof) This highlights the importance of being mindful of our social media 
usage and finding ways to limit distractions in order to improve our attention span. Because of 
this rapid access to information, a culture of fast-paced, bite-sized content that is easily 
devoured and forgotten has developed. People are conditioned to anticipate rapid satisfaction and 
instant access to new information, this shift in how people absorb information has resulted in 
shorter attention spans. To reduce the negative effects of social media on attention span, people 
should set limits on their social media use. This might involve establishing regular times of day 
to check social media or establishing time limitations for each session.
</p>


<h2>
How Does Attention Span Affect School Life
</h2>
<p>
Social media has become very prevalent in today’s youth, which has begun to conflict with 
children’s school lives. The effects from social media can range from making students lose 
track of time when they are doing homework to damaging their attention spans, making it harder 
to focus in class. This has detrimental effects on the youth’s education, which can be harmful 
to them in the future. An experiment was conducted within BridgeWater State University, in 
which the conductor, Audrey Mekler, would conduct surveys seeing how Tik Tok usage and different 
aspects of school would coincide. The surveys would span a multitude of questions, mainly with 
respect to their attention span. Her overall results showed that the young college students were 
“more likely to lose track of time on TikTok” as they were using it throughout the day, and this 
would inadvertently “negatively impact how these college students” would perform in class (150). 
In lecture, students are shown to have decreasing attention spans as they progress, as explained 
in the article entitled <i>Attention span during lectures: 8 seconds? 10 minutes, or more?</i> 
by Neil Bradbury, “Although student attention is high at the start of a lecture, it has reached 
a low point after 10-15 minutes.” (Bradbury, 509). Lectures being such an integral part of college 
education means that the ability to absorb long-form informational lesions is essential to scholastic 
success.This just shows how it is affected in college, however it is reflected within highschools 
and even some elementary schools with students that have access to social media. When their 
education is harmed it can often lead to other harmful effects within their lives, like anxiety 
and stress. 
</p>
<p>
This shows how potentially dangerous the use of social media can be on the youth when they use 
it in excess amounts. Both of the studies showed that the more that it used, the more that social 
media usage is linked to anxiety and depression, and then on a further level, harmful school 
habits. This should be something that is more focused on, since a good mentality and education 
early on in one’s life can be a strong foundation for their future. However, that is not to say 
that social media should be completely taken out of the lives of the youth. Social media can still 
be beneficial to the youth. While not the main appeal of social media, there are a lot of 
educational sources on it, and it can be used to help people in school at times. In addition 
it can help them build a social life with others. With all things, social media can be beneficial 
for the youth, but with moderation, and that said moderation is almost never present, which leads 
to the previously mentioned negative effects. More people have to be educated at a young age to be 
able to find the perfect balance between what is too much social media, and how much can be 
potentially beneficial to the youth. A lot of this can be controlled through parental controls on 
phones, which should be an issue for parents who give their children access to social media.
</p>


<h2>
Effects on Other Aspects of Life
</h2>
<p>
When it comes to understanding the way social media affects people’s minds, it’s important to 
realize how these apps are engineered. Many of the most popular social media apps are constructed 
with the purpose of capturing people’s attention and giving them quick hits of dopamine. Take 
TikTok for example, this app offers an endless stream of short-form content, with users being 
able to skip to the next video with the swipe of a finger. This manipulation of dopamine is shown 
to be harmful for children in the long term, and can hinder the ability to find enjoyment in 
typical activities, as explained in the article <i>TikTok Brain Explained: Why Some Kids Seem Hooked 
on Social Video Themes</i> by Julie Jargon  “...watching short, fast-paced videos makes it harder for 
kids to sustain activities that don’t offer instant and constant gratification.” (Jargon 2). The 
reason the short videos, also known as reels, are making it harder for kids to sustain activities 
is because they create a shorter attention span. Constantly watching short, information-filled 
videos will diminish youths’ attention. 
</p>
<p>
With youth putting a lot of their attention within social media, they will put themselves out 
onto it for others to see. This can make them constantly worried about how they are perceived 
by others online, which can often generate a lot of anxiety within. There is research that 
was conducted within Chinese highschools, with students who used an abundance of social media, 
mainly focusing on Tik Tok, that shows how they correlated with students memory loss, anxiety, 
and depression issues. They went through over 300 participants and went through medical history 
with aforementioned issues. It was found that it was “positively linked to depression, anxiety, 
and stress”, which would then in turn contribute to problems with memory loss as these would 
build up (Sha 9). These problems would be very valuable to look into getting fixed, because they 
will bleed into students' personal lives. 
</p>
<p>
While social media negatively affecting educational performance is certainly a bad thing, an 
arguably worse result of heavy social-media use is the decline of student mental health. This 
issue expands beyond the classroom and can be very serious compared to simply getting lower 
grades; As explained in the article entitled <i>Competing Against Outside Distractions in Online 
Classrooms for Grade-School Students</i> by Michael Gillick, “Students who spent more time on media 
had higher levels of emotional distress, lacked energy and focus, had lower GPA’s, and overall 
worse performance” (Gillick 3). With the ongoing mental health crisis among today’s youth, social 
media factoring into the equation certainly isn’t a good thing. Some would claim that the over-use 
of social media among young people is a large contributing factor to this mental health crisis. 
Essentially, social media usage creates collateral damage, negatively affecting young people in a 
multitude of ways.
</p>


<h2>
How are People Trying to fix the Younger Generations’ Attention Spans?
</h2>
<p>
Reversing the damage that has been done to younger generations is nearly impossible considering 
how long they’ve had access to technology. There is no simple way to put it, but since the world 
is expanding around technology and children are being raised with it all around them there is no 
easy way out. Growing up with social media especially affects the younger generation by reeling 
them in for hours to watch short and rewarding videos. Numerous social media directors have 
included ways to allow the viewer to acknowledge their time spent on the app. These companies say 
they want, “...younger teens to develop positive digital habits early on,” and are implementing 
different things that could potentially help (Jargon 2). Ways such as adding in short clips 
reminding viewers how long they’ve been scrolling for or including a certain time for push 
notifications to stop. By including these, social media apps have taken a step towards a better 
technology influenced generation. 
</p>
<p>
Not only is social media affecting the younger generation, but technology is too. Schools have 
started to adapt more to the technology side of work because that’s what is best for the kids’ 
attention spans. Students that have chosen to complete school online have nothing stopping them 
from going over to the tv and spending their time doing something more enjoyable. Students enrolled 
online may also not have the best work environment so some schools believe that, “Online courses 
must be dynamic and tailored to meet the needs of the students…”(Gillick 9). This being said, 
although technology has some effect on childrens’ minds doesn’t mean it’s all bad for them. By 
working with what they think will help maintain students’ attention spans, schools are trying to 
find beneficial ways to keep students on track at home. 
</p>
<p>
Social media and technology is incredibly addictive considering how often people check their 
phones or how long they spend watching videos or scrolling through posts. It has gotten to the 
point where people are becoming aware of how long they spend online themselves. Researchers have 
found that, “...24% of adolescents describe themselves as “constantly connected” to the Internet
<sup>6</sup> and 50% report feeling “addicted” to their phone” (Chassiakos 3). By becoming aware 
of an obsession, it helps put someone into focus and helps them realize what they need to do to 
better themself. 
</p>


<h2>
Conclusion
</h2>
<p>
With this being said, the youth's attention span has been deteriorating almost as fast as the 
short videos on many social media platforms go by. It has been shown that the harm of attention 
spans has affected the youth mostly negatively within their lives.However, there are ways that 
people are using to try and combat the harmful effects, and with these efforts hopefully we can 
find a balance for social media in the lives of the youth.

<h2>
Addendum
</h2>
<p>
My plan once I had my roommate's (Caleb Swapp) paper started with me reading the paper though and note
every part that's italicized, bolded, and or underlined. After that I went through each paragraph
and made note of each paragaph's title so that I knew what I'd have to make subtitles for this 
webpage. When it came to actually pasting the paper into the webpage, my plan is to go one paragraph
at a time, going through it and adding the necessary formating and checking it before going to the 
next one. <br/>
After going throuhg the paper I've deduced I'm going to need the italicize tag, the superscript tag, 
link tag, along with the structural tags like the line break, paragraph, headings one and two, 
and the article tag. the following are what tags I need and what they correspond to in HTML: <br/>
italicize = &lti&gt <br/>
superscript = &ltsup&gt <br/>
link = &lta href="url"&gt <br/>
line break = &ltbr/&gt <br/>
heading one = &lth1&gt <br/>
heading two = &lth2&gt <br/>
article = &ltarticle&gt <br/>
Additionally, I'm going to have to learn some styling, such as how to center text, how to change 
font sizes, and how to indent.
